Editing HMT project material at Trinity University.


## Work for Fall, 2014 ##


Basic infrastructure for working with digital representations of manuscripts:

1. creating a model of the page sequences of the Genavensis (Bibliothèque de Genève, ms. gr. 44)

*URNs for the codex model:*

**Folio** urn:cite:hmt:gen44.**side**

**side** indicates the porition of the reference that is variable. You need to add the folio number and whether it is recto or verso. The URN for folio 1r would be urn:cite:hmt:gen44.1r

**Default Image** urn:cite:ecod:gen44.gen44_**X**

**X** indicates the portion of the reference that is variable. You can acquire the default image reference from the image citation browser at this link: http://www.homermultitext.org/hmt-digital/browseimg?urn=urn:cite:ecod:gen44

The default image for folio 1r would be urn:cite:ecod:gen44.gen44_001

2. creating a navigational index of *Iliad* lines in the Geneva MS


Advanced editing work:


- middle of *Iliad* 13 in the Venetus A:  folios 169 verso - 174 verso (inclusive)
